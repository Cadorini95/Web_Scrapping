# Web_Scrapping
 The goal of this repository is to share codes using different tools to extract information from internet.
 
The first two deploys are examples using the Selenium library. The codes are in .ipynb format and have a brief description to install Selenium library considering Google Chrome as the main navigator. 

In the next deploys, we aim to develop examples consuming APIs and extract data using this tool.
